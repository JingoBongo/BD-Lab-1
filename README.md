# BD-Lab-2

In this lab. I created 2 databases, put them in folders Data and Logs, added some additional properties to them.

Later I created 2 maintenance plans wich are supposed to do different operations with my databases.

Unfortunately, shrink plan has failed (it was was a succes untill I tried to execute the plan and see the report.)

As well as task 4, I did a plan, it was executed with an error, but this time report was fine and assured me that the plan works.

I did everything just like the book tells me and I'd like to know what is wrong.
