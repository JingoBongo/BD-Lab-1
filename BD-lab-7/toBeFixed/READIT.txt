Once again, these files just mean I care about completing DB labs, just don't have anough time to fix my own mssql. 
these exercises in lab 7 are not mine by any point, I just need more time. (I cannot do my homework due to mssql problems. Fot example it 
now marks everything in red and says that this thing is an error etc, but the query works. And when I get actual errors I can't even see where they are)

Now I have updated university (not universitatea this time) database, I'm trying to fix lab 6 in order to do this one, but once again,
I have problems like i mentioned before.
